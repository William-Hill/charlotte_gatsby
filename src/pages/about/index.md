I act. I sing. I model. I create.

<br>

I am a Creative with a passion for crafting visual stories.

Charlotte Christien is a Bay Area artist. She moved to the Bay just over 5 years ago from Alabama. As a small town girl, her dream were always bigger than what her peers could handle. Serendipity would lead her to find herself entranced with the creative styles of performance. Film. Theatre. Music. Aerial dance. All would eventually become interwoven in the tapestry that is Charlotte.

“At this point in my training and career, I am motivated to pull the different influences of my life and creative fires together. I have a burning desire to present outside the box and challenge what is the actual box.I see many conversations being sparked and I can’t wait to hear them.”
