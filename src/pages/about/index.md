I act. I sing. I model. I create.

I am a Meisner trained actress with a passion for crafting visual stories

Charlotte Christien is a Bay Area artist. She moved to the Bay just over 5 years ago from Alabama. As a small town girl, her dream were always bigger than what her peers could handle. However, an injury derailed her plans to become a world renowned chef. Serendipity would lead her to find herself entranced with the creative styles of performance. Film. Theatre. Music. Aerial dance. All would eventually become interwoven in the tapestry that is Charlotte.

Early on Charlotte decided she was going to pursue a career as a chef. She grew up helping her grandmother cook weekly meals and even large holiday meals. Charlotte attended culinary school and graduated in 2012. After working in every food department at a beach resort, she moved to California in July 2013. She continued her culinary career as a pastry chef working at a French/Italian bakery. Then at a Chinese/French-Canadian fusion patisserie. Unfortunately, a back injury forced her to discontinue her culinary career.

2015 brought the opportunity to dip her toe in the intensity of actor training in a five week Meisner technique intensive. Following this intensive, she decided in 2016 to continue her training in a one year conservatory program under Racheal Adler at Waterfront Playhouse in Berkeley, CA. In addition, a trial week of acrobatic classes confirmed that aerial artistry was the place to bring all of Charlotte’s creative experiences together. Acrobatic classes fueled her!

During this Meisner training, Charlotte used a writing assignment to channel the frustrations of external world into a dystopian prediction of the future. This short 3-person, 2-scene play was chosen by her peers/classmates to appear in the final showcase of the graduating class. Instructor Rachael Adler compared her writing to the works of novelist Margaret Atwood. She began to wonder if storytelling of the stage could be incorporated with aerial expression.
Following graduation from the Meisner training program, Charlotte was cast in back-to-back theatrical roles with three diverse companies in the Bay Area. African American American Shakespeare Company, Bay Area Children’s Theater, and Ubuntu Theater Project. Following these works, her desire to hone her craft led to being accepted into the 2018 Summer Training Congress at American Conservatory Theatre.

In the summer of 2019, Charlotte will move behind the scenes to create and direct an aerial and creative expression show premiering in the Bay Area. The focus is the disconnect and misconceptions among the Descendants of the Diaspora, those stolen away and those who remained on the shores.
These and more are the stories Charlotte wishes to tackle and explore with the creative collaboration of fellow artists in the area. “At this point in my training and career, I am motivated to pull the different influences of my life and creative fires together. I have a burning desire to present outside the box and challenge what is the actual box.I see many conversations being sparked and I can’t wait to hear them.”
