From the East Bay Times: 

"Georgia, a teenager, finds herself forced to live with her dad and his boyfriend. It's not too bad-the boyfriend, Atkins, seems nice and is even planning a traditional Filipina debut for her. But her dad is another story. These two characters join together in Boni Alvarez's "The Debut of Georgia" Charlotte Christien as Georgia and Melvign Badiola as Atkins. Directed by Ely Sonny Orquiza for Theatre Rhinoceros, the live Zoom performance takes place Oct. 13 at 7pm. Viewing the Zoom performance is free, but registration is required. Go to[ http://therhino.org/](http://therhino.org/) . 

If you miss the live performance, never fear. The show will join the many others available for streaming on the company's website..."
