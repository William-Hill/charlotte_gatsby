My latest work takes place as we follow a young girl on her journey through the women’s history museum. Here Naomi travels through time to meet several history making women who help her find the persistance to walk on to her future. I play Florence Griffith Joyner (Flo-Jo) and Ruby Bridges. Get your tickets to witness this inspiring story today!
